    ## Implications for Heat Stress

    Heat stress is a natural hazard that causes a large number of fatalities globally. In the coming decades, climate change may cause more frequent heat waves, which could exacerbate heat stress. Future urban growth could also strengthen the urban heat island effect, causing more severe heat stress. Urban populations may face greater health impacts due to heat stress.

    In urban areas, a variety of individual, social, and geographic factors determine an individual's heat risk (Reckien et al. 2018). Social structures and segregation in urban areas can exacerbate risk, leading to unequal heat exposure. This scenario is playing out in Houston, Texas. In this discovery, we'll use NASA Earth observations to explore heat stress inequalities in Houston over the past 20 years.

  ## Envrionmental inequality in Houston, TX
  Houston is the site of some of the earliest studies of environmental inequality. Robert Bullard, known as the “father of environmental justice,”  proved that waste facilities were disproportionately sited in poor and minority neighborhoods as far back as the late 1970s (Bullard 1983). Today, this kind of research is still important in Houston, which is among the most racially segregated cities in the United States (Logan et al. 2013). In 2012, Houston was ranked the most economically segregated metropolitan area in the entire country (Fry and Taylor 2012). According to this study, 24% of high-income households live in high-income neighborhoods and 37% of low-income households reside in low-income neighborhoods (Fry and Taylor 2012).

    ## Using satellite data to study urban heat

    We can use satellite data to get a complete picture of urban heat in this large city. Combined with socioeconomic information, there is a lot to learn about the impacts of urban growth on urban heat. To understand how the city is changing over time we used data about land cover. This information comes from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD), which classifies land cover types in areas as small as 30m x 30m every 3 years. Greenspace also plays a big role in urban heat. To measure vegetation, such as trees and grass, we use a metric called the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). On this scale, bare ground = 0 and dense vegetation = 1. This information comes from the NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra platform.
  
    To study urban heat, we used land surface temperature (LST) data, also from Terra MODIS. LST does not measure air temperature, but instead measures how hot the pavement is under your feet. Increases in LST are generally associated with increases in air temperature and heat stress.

    All this Earth science information is useful for understanding the geography of heat. To understand the impact on humans, we need human information. That comes from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) quantifies poverty within each census tract.

    ### Landcover
    Using land cover maps, we were able to measure the increase of urban and built-up land cover. We found that the area of urban and built-up land cover increased by more than 20% in the last two decades. By comparing land cover maps from 2001 and 2019, we can see a substantial increase in urban areas along the southwestern part of the city. We can do a similar comparison with average temperature. Figure 2 shows average temperature from 2000-2009 compared to 2010-2019. The maps show higher average temperatures over similar regions in the southwestern part of the city. These higher temperatures carry into the night, too, although they are less intense.

      We utilized ATSDR SVI to categorize changes in decadal average LST and NDVI as a function of poverty. Our analysis shows that economically disadvantaged populations are subject to higher exposure to urban-enhanced heat stress and, potentially, less access to green spaces.

    Finally, we combined the socioeconomic information with these changes in heat and land cover. Our analysis shows that economically disadvantaged populations are subject to great heat stress. At the same time, they may also face decreased access to green spaces. In 2020, areas in Harris county with poverty levels >10% are 22°F (12.23°C) hotter than areas where the poverty level is < 10% [F(4, 27.5) = 11.1, p < .001]. Areas with similar levels of poverty experience similar levels of heat stress. This disparity stands out in sharp contrast to the large temperature difference between high and low poverty areas. Between higher poverty areas, the average LST differs by only 0.13°F (0.7°C). Between lower poverty areas, the average LST differs by a mere 0.04°F (0.02°C).

    As with temperature, an analysis of 2020 vegetation data showed a significant difference based on levels of poverty [F(4, 27.5) = 4.57, p = .006]. Areas with the lowest poverty levels (< 5%) have approximately 6% more vegetation than areas with the highest poverty levels (>20%). Even small increases or decreases in vegetation can affect how residents experience heat.
